Kiss Lint is a WIP linter for Kiss Linux packages based on the style guide
(https://kisscommunity.bvnf.space/kiss/style-guide).

=== Building
============

Run 'cargo build --release'.

=== Testing
===========

The included 'test_pkg' is designed to throw every possible error that a package
could generate. Try running '../target/release/kiss-lint' from inside it.

=== Progress
============

This is a list of all parts of the style guide that are currently intended to
be added. This may extend to other parts in future, but at the moment these are
the parts that seem to be verifiable and/or are not covered by 'kiss c'.
